Welcome to UDOO Docs's documentation!
=====================================

What's UDOO?

UDOO is a mini PC that can be used both with Android and Linux OS, with an embedded Arduino-compatible board. 
It is a powerful prototyping board for software development and design; it’s easy to use and allows developing projects
with minimum knowledge of hardware. UDOO merges different computing worlds together: each one has its proper strengths 
and weak points, but all of them are useful in todays life for educational purposes as well as Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and 
quick prototyping. UDOO is an open hardware, low-cost platform equipped with an ARM i.MX6 Freescale processor, and 
an Arduino Due compatible section based on ATMEL SAM3X8E ARM processor, all this available on the same board!


UDOO goals:

Develop an innovative product for a growing market.
Give a new vision to the educational framework, with the idea of training up a new generation of engineers, designers 
and software developers skilled in digital technology: physical computing, multi-media arts, interactive arts, IoT...
Give a boost to the DIY world
Offer a low cost embedded platform for interactive arts with powerful tools: Processing, OpenCV, PureData, openFramework
Provide companies with a great tool for fast prototyping

Specifications

UDOO retail line up consists of three models, sharing most of the features and different only for connectivity and i.MX6 processor used. All three models feature an embedded Arduino compatible section based on Arduino Due schematic. UDOO’s dimensions are: 4.33 inch x 3.35 inch (11 cm x 8.5 cm).
Warning: The UDOO I/O pins are 3.3V compliant. Higher voltages (like 5V) would damage the board.
