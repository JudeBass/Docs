UDOO Specifications
###################


UDOO retail line up consists of three models, sharing most of the features and different only for connectivity 
and i.MX6 processor used. All three models feature an embedded Arduino compatible section based on Arduino Due schematics. UDOO’s dimensions are: 4.33 inch x 3.35 inch (11 cm x 8.5 cm).

Warning: The UDOO I/O pins are 3.3V compliant. Higher voltages (like 5V) would damage the board.

=============
GPIO features
=============


 - S/PDIF digital audio in & out through pin headers;
 - I2S/AC97/SSI digital audio multiplexer through pin headers;
 - FlexCAN (Flexible Controller Area Network) through pin headers, it is possible to switch this function’s management
 between i.MX6 processor and SAM3X8E processor;
 - External SD card support through pins header: plug an external controller for an additional SD card slot or for an 
 eMMC module.
